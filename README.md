### Calculator (2025)

This is a digital calculator interface with a dark gray background and black buttons featuring red text. The display screen at the top shows the number 5.4. It includes standard arithmetic keys (0–9, +, −, ×, ÷, =), along with additional functions such as square root (√), power (^), floor, ceil, absolute value (abs), percent (%), delete (Del), and AC (All Clear). The layout is simple and rectangular, with a modern color contrast between the red symbols and black buttons.
