### Calculator (2025)

This calculator includes standard arithmetic keys (0–9, +, −, ×, ÷, =), along with additional functions such as square root (√), power (^), floor, ceil, absolute value (abs), percent (%), delete (Del), and AC (All Clear). The layout is simple and rectangular, with a modern color contrast between the red symbols and black buttons.
